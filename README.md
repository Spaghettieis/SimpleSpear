My own contribution, i.e. the .p3d model, the configuration text and the changes to the texture files are free for anyone to use without attribution (CC0 aka Public Domain license). 
So long as you don´t make money off the model (breaking KIFIR´s NC license) and mention them as the model creator (BY license) you can repack this mod, reupload this mod under your name, and use it on monetized servers.
